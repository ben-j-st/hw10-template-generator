<div align="right"><img alt="licence badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/licence-MIT-yellow"></div>

## Description 

Using command line, I built a profile generator using pre generated templates of various different html elements and a main html page that combines them, the information on the profiles is populated from a series of question using inquirer prompts. Questions are specific to the type of team member the user wants to add.
